# Kronopendia: Interactive Timeline Visualization Platform

## Project Summary
The Kronopendia is a platform for building, sharing, and collaborating on interactive timelines covering any topic or period across 13.8 billion years of history. The core innovation is the ability to create constrained timelines for specific periods and embed them within a "Universal Timeline" that spans all of known history. This project forms the first phase of the broader "Kompendia Project," which will extend similar principles to values beyond time.

## Core Design Philosophy
Kronopendia employs a hierarchical visual system that maintains context and detail across vastly different time scales, from billions of years to minutes or seconds. The system uses consistent visual language and dynamic scaling to create an intuitive navigation experience through time.

## Key Components
The Kronopendia system is built around eight foundational concepts:

### Structural Elements
- **SCAFFOLD**: The framework elements (Spine and Spokes) that form the temporal backbone
- **SUBSTANCE**: The content elements (Spots and Spans) that provide historical information
- **SPACING**: The organizational structures (Slots and Slices) that arrange elements visually

### Functional Systems
- **SIZE**: The representation levels that control element appearance and detail
- **STEP**: The sequence points that define the progression of intervals
- **SCOPE**: The viewing and property contexts that determine relevance and inheritance
- **DETAILS**: The content and styling properties that enrich timeline elements
- **DYNAMICS**: The interactive behaviors that occur during timeline navigation

## Current Status
This project is currently in early development, focusing on building the core SCAFFOLD components and basic navigation functionality.

## Development Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Core Structure - Implement Spine and Spokes with basic zoom/pan functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Basic Visualization - Add Spots and Spans with sequence management
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced Interaction - Implement Slots system and advanced navigation
4. **Phase 4**: Polish and Integration - Add visual refinements and editor interface
